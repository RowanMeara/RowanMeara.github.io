description: "I created EsportsTracker.net, an analytics and statistics site that pulls in viewership data from multiple streaming platforms. EsportsTracker's backend is built using Python microservices which scrape, aggregate, and eventually store viewership data in a PostgreSQL instance. I made the web application and API using the Express framework for Node.js, due to its high performance and lightweight caching that is perfect for database heavy analytics applications. I created EsportsTracker because currently, even professional gaming and esports analytics websites like newzoo omit YouTube Gaming, which skews their popularity rankings heavily in favor of companies that only broadcast on Twitch, such as Valve. This then sinks the rankings of companies that choose to stream on multiple platforms, such as Riot Games (approximately 40% of its viewership is on YouTube)."
